# dc-bot
A Discord bot for my Discord server.
## install the dependencies
```npm install discord.js```
## create a dotenv file and add your token
```TOKEN=your_token```
## run the bot
```node index.js```

### note
I deploy this bot on Railway, so I don't need to run it locally. 
If you want to run it locally, you need to install the dependencies and create a dotenv file. 
If you want to deploy it on Railway, you need to create a Railway app and add the "token" as a config var.
